<p>
Hi there! I am Dongyang Li (李东洋), a 2nd-year M.S. student in <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=liuqy&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1">NCClab@SUSTech</a>, major in Electronic Engineering at <a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/">Southern University of Science and Technology</a>, Shenzhen, China. 
                  My supervisor is <a href="https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/liuquanying.html">Prof. Quanying Liu</a>. Now I am also closely working with <a href="https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~cz277/">Prof. Chao Zhang</a>.
</p>

I am committed to creating artificial intelligence to advance the world through the analysis and understanding of neural and behavioral data from the human brain. I specialize in delving into complex brain functions to clarify and extract valuable insights to solve problems. 

Now my research interests focus on **LLMs**, **Foundation Models** and **Brain-inspired AI**. With these experiences, my goal is to continue to learn and grow and enjoy new challenges in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence.
