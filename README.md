# Dongyang Li 
Hi there! I am committed to creating artificial intelligence to advance the world through the analysis and understanding of neural and behavioral data from the human brain. I specialize in delving into complex brain functions to clarify and extract valuable insights to solve problems. Through various projects, I have enhanced data-driven decision-making and developed efficient algorithms for solving practical brain-computer interface problems. With these experiences, my goal is to continue to learn and grow and enjoy new challenges in the fields of data science and artificial intelligence.
